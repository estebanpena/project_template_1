# Laying the groundwork



This will be our first offical template that we work on as a team. The first repo I made ("template") was more of a list of examples to use as the starting point for our own template, this one. Not very original I know.
The point isnt to reinvent the wheel, its to make the wheel well, and in large quantites. The plan is that we both work on this project together so that end-result comes out better than if we just did it ourselves. Also a caveat with working with two people is we can get it done faster, and you also get different perspectives. 
We can learn from eachother and also simply by coding. We need a space for our code to exist so as to give it a chance to grow and evolve. I believe code is alive like our consititustion, it's a living breathing document. We breath life into it, and with intention, we can make some dope shit I know it. Look once we know what we want to do with this, its over. But let's start here.



Pre-req: You need have downloaded Node.js and if on Mac XCode Tools, if on pc, google this but also download git. You need to be able to use all the git commads on terminal(git clone, git add, git commit -m, etc) and some terminal commands(cd, cat, rm, etc). Also I trust you to be able to decern when to commit to main and when to make a new branch.



So the task is this:

  1.)clone my "template" repository and this repo using ssh or html
  2.)take the training__studio template from the file and upload it to this repo

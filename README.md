# Laying the groundwork(GitHub 101)



The Intro: Learning to use GitHub is an inevitibility, just think of it like learing how to use Instagram. Except you actually need to do reasearch. 

Re-cap (Why we're doing this):
  
  The point: The point isn't to reinvent the wheel, it's to make the wheel well, and in large quantities. 
  The logic: If we both work on this project together, we can get the work done faster, be outputting 2x more stuff, and the result comes out better than if we just              did it ourselves. We'll be able to give constructive feedback in real-time so we can help eachother out. Also it's to ensure that we're in fact putting              out straight gas. In the future, our skills will be traced back to this foundation. 
  The goal: Refinement and Output.
  The assumption: You can hold your own weight

Closing remarks: We need a space for our code to exist to give it a chance to grow and evolve. I believe code is alive like our constitution, it's a living breathing document. We breathe life into it, and with intention, we can make some dope shit. Let's start here.


Pre-req: You need to have downloaded Node.js and if on Mac XCode Tools, check if you have them first(git --version),(node -v). If when you try to clone it ask you to download XCode Tools click yes. You need to be able to use all the git commands on terminal(git clone, git add, git commit -m, etc) and some terminal commands(cd, cat, rm, etc). Also, I trust you to be able to decern when to commit to main and when to make a new branch.


The Background: The first repo I made ("template") is a list of templates to use as the starting point for our templates. Not very original I know.

So the task is this:

  1.)clone this repo and the "template" repo using ssh or html 
  2.)take the training__studio template from the file and upload it to this repo
  
  

If you have a question or if im moving too slow anything hmu on discord:https://discord.gg/6ztd5yb9vD or just google it.

# Laying the groundwork



The Background/Intro: The first repo I made ("template") is a list of templates to use as the starting point for our templates. Not very original I know.

The point: The point isn't to reinvent the wheel, it's to make the wheel well, and in large quantities. 

The logic: If we both work on this project together, we can get the work done faster, be outputting 2x more stuff, and the result comes out better than if we just did it ourselves. We'll be able to give constructive feedback in real-time so we can help eachother out. Also it's to ensure that we're in fact putting out straight gas. In the future, our skills will be traced back to this foundation. Refinement and Output.

Closing remarks: We need a space for our code to exist to give it a chance to grow and evolve. I believe code is alive like our constitution, it's a living breathing document. We breathe life into it, and with intention, we can make some dope shit. Look once we know what we want to do with this, we can change course but for now, let's start here.



Pre-req: You need to have downloaded Node.js and if on Mac XCode Tools, if on pc, google this but also download git. You need to be able to use all the git commands on terminal(git clone, git add, git commit -m, etc) and some terminal commands(cd, cat, rm, etc). Also, I trust you to be able to decern when to commit to main and when to make a new branch.


So the task is this:

  1.)clone my "template" repository and this repo using ssh or html 
  2.)take the training__studio template from the file and upload it to this repo

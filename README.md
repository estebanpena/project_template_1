# Laying down the groundwork




This will be our first offical template that we work on as a team. The first repo I made was more of a list of examples to use as the starting point for our own template, this one. 




The hope is we can both work on this together so that result comes out better than if we just did it ourselves. Also faster, Also two brains are better than one lol. So if some sort of error were to arise and you weren't able to fix it that day, I can come on try to fix it and vice versa. Pre-req: You need to be able to use git commads on terminal(git clone, git add, git commit -m, etc). Also I trust you to be able to decern when to commit to main and when to make a new branch. If you have a question or anything else hmu on discord:https://discord.gg/6ztd5yb9vD
